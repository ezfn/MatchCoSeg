Boosting Local Matches with Convolutional Co-Segmentation
	Dependencies:
	1. OpenCV for python
	2. Tensorflow (1.5 and above) - earlier versions not tested
	3. Matplotlib (for visualization)

	Currently available:
	1. A freezed un-optimized tensorflow model for Alligned Co-Segmentation (example: "/eval/allignedCoSegImages.py").
	   Note: This allows co-segmentation between images that were already alligned.

	To be added:
	1. Optimized tensorflow model for Alligned Co-Segmentation
	2. Code for training alligned Co-Segmentation in tensorflow
	3. Initial matching and frame allignment code.
